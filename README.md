# rwa
Package for running Relative Weights Analysis in R

Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) method of calculating relative importance of predictor variables in contributing to an outcome variable. The method implemented by this function is based on Toniandel and LeBreton (2015). Broadly speaking, RWA belongs to a family of techiques under the broad umbrella 'Relative Importance Analysis', where other members include the 'Shapley method' and 'dominance analysis'.

In short, RWA decomposes the total variance predicted in a regression model (R2) into weights that accurately reï¬‚ect the proportional contribution of the various predictor variables.
